Martial Arts is a popular hobby amongst a wide variety of people for thousands of years.

Many have a Sporting Focus, while others are geared toward practical self defence.

The cost, and availability of Martial Arts depends on your area. Do research and take a trial class!

Many Dojos require a contract, and require certain equipment (Gi, Helmets etc). If your strapped for cash, Karate and Judo are quite cheap.

Please note, that like many sports, there is potential for injury. Brazillian Jiu Jutsu, for example, is notorious for Joint Injuries. It will be best for you to use caution, don't overwork yourself, and tap out early.

Self Defense:

- Brazillian Jiu Jutsu (Very Efficient Wrestling, designed for accessibility)
- Muay Thai (Boxing, but you don't just use your arms)
- Boxing (Hit person until they fall down. Very effective.)
- Krav Maga (Military Self Defence. Potentially Lethal. WARNING has a reputation for bad instructors!)

Sports:

- Judo (Throws and Wrestling. Good for Self Defence)
- Karate (You know what this is)
- Taekwondo (Korean Kicking Art)
- Greco Roman Wrestling (WWE but no script)
