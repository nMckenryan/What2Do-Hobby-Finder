Enter a world of Swords and Sorcery! (or Spaceships and Aliens, or Vampires and Gangs Wars)

Role Playing Board Games (RPGs) allow you to create a character and interact with a fantasy world, interpretted to you by a Dungeon Master.

You can make any character you want! DO anything you want (within the confines of the game world's rules.)

The outcome of each action is determined with the roll of a dice, most commonly a 20 Sided Dice. Rolling a 1 means a catastrophic failure, while Rolling a 20 is a overwhelming success!

These RPGs are very popular, especially Dungeons and Dragons.

You can find games via:

- MeetUp.com Groups
- Facebook Events
- Events at your Local Game Store (Note, many store run 'Adventurer's League' Nights, which allows for players to drop in.)

Check out online for more guides, or swing by your friendly local game shop.
