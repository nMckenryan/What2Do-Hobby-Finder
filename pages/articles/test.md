Welcome to the world of Tabletop Gaming! Famously played by many of history's

Invented in the 19th Century in Prussia (now Germany), Wargaming has helped modern militaries prepare for their engagements.

The most famous Wargames are Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, a High Fantasy Setting, and it's Sci-Fi Fantasy Counterpart, Warhammer 40k.

While Popular, Warhammer of both varietals is incredibly expensive (~\1000k for a full army, but 'Skirmish' Modes are much cheaper)

If you're strapped for cash, you can also try 'Kings of War', which is MUCH cheaper.

Many people also forgo the 'game', and focus on painting the miniatures themselves.
