Go outside! Go find a hill, and climb it, and take photos, then climb back down.

The only thing you'll need to get started is a decent pair of Hiking Shoes. Plus a transportation method. 

This hobby is EXTREMELY popular, and will likely help you connect with many people.

If you like it, you can expand into Camping/Survivalism. Depending on the Biome, you could also pursue Skiing, Mountaineering, Canoeing, or a variety of other hobbies! 

Go find a place you've never been to and climb up it this weekend! then Check Meetup.org to hike with likeminded people!
