Airsoft is a team sport where players elinimate each other with BB Guns. BB Guns resemble Real World Weapons and Players are often don Military Style Uniforms and Equipment.

Paintball is similar, The guns are less flashy, but it's harder to cheat. When you get hit, everyone knows because you're splattered with Paint.

Game modes available often mirror FPS game modes (Capture the Flag, Deathmatch etc),

You can technically play with just a simple Airsoft/Paintball Gun, but you may need some belts of bandoliers to hold your magazines or pellets.

The style of Guns available for purchase depends on your country. If your country has a ban on Automatic Weapons, only semi-automatic Airsoft/Paintball Guns will be available.

Look for a Facebook Group in your area to learn more about your local Airsoft/Paintball Scene.
